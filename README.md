# 💫 About Me:
Hey there! 👋 As a software engineer since 2013, I've delved into a wide range of programming languages, from Java and Node.js to Golang. But what truly sparked my career was my introduction to blockchain in 2017! Web3 projects quickly became my ultimate passion, and I got totally hyped up about how they empower individuals with ownership of their own keys. On this journey, I thrive on crafting user-centric web3 solutions that emphasize decentralization, transparency, and security. Let's collaborate and make the decentralized world even more exciting! 🚀
